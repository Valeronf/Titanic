# Titanic
I developed a neural network program in Python that predicts survival outcomes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model processes Titanic passenger data to forecast whether an individual survived the disaster. The program utilizes various features and data points to make accurate predictions, contributing to the understanding of survival patterns aboard the Titanic!
